## Overview
I was in charge of the whole design process for Perfeqt, a wellness parameters tracking app using urine test that you can do it at your own convenience. 
My role covered everything from the initial benchmarking, designing, handing over to developers, and maintaining the appâ€™s user experience. So far, Perfeqt's doing pretty well with over 12K people signed up and 11K product subscriptions.
