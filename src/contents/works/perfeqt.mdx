## Overview
I was in charge of the whole design process for Perfeqt. My role covered everything from the initial benchmarking, designing, handing over to developers, and maintaining the appâ€™s user experience.

## Context
Perfeqt is a wellness insight product using urine test card that you can do it at your own convenience, also featuring a personalized lifestyle plan, food recommendations, and customized supplements.

## Discovery
We're checking out some products that share similar mindset from the user experience perspective. This helps us see what competitors are doing.

Based on what we found, we're sorting them by asking:

- **How easy is it to use on my own?**
- **Can I tailor it to my own speed and situation?**

Our product user experience should hit the sweet spot, get the wellness parameters insight in no time, conveniently at home, or any location of their choice.

**Vivoo** approach is pretty much what we're aiming for, so we decided to use it as the **UX benchmark**.

## Ideation
Given the tight deadline, I opted for an "Copy and Modify" approach to quickly generate ideas, focusing on achieving maximum impact with minimal effort.

## Interaction Tree Map
I put together my findings into an Interaction Tree Map, which is a great way to organize all the info architecture. It lays out user interactions visually, making connections clearer and the whole experience smoother.

The benefits of Interaction Tree Map are allow us to do early reviews with stakeholders, gives a clear overview of existing features and screens, and eliminates the need for an additional user flow. And I feel confident to move forward with the design phase.

## Design Discovery

I started with building new reusable UI kits and assets needed, integrating them into the existing design library in alignment with the existing design guidelines.

Based on the Interaction Tree Map, we also need some animations to showcase the test-taking process. Then, I created the animations using Lottie, a tool specifically designed for building motion graphics for UI designer.

## Revenue Impact
Perfeqt has grown 5 times since 2021, driven by strong momentum in the at-home testing market, solid marketing effort, and effective product adoption with user centered constant iterations. So far, Perfeqt's doing pretty well with over 12K people signed up and 11K product subscriptions.

## Final Thought
**What could I have done better?**
Sure we're far from perfect, there was unclear value to our customers, especially where people tend to use our competitors more compared to our products. By really understanding their problem, I hoped that we're able to create value that fills the unmet problem which aren't satisfied by our competitors.

**What did I learn?**
I learned that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to satisfy the users problem. What works on Vivoo may not work on Perfeqt. Understanding the unique needs of the products users is key in creating a feature that will work for your product. I kept looking at what other similar products were doing, instead of just trying to focus on the actual problem. Once I did, the answer was right in front of me.
