## Overview
Gamestark is a backend-as-a-service platform that helps game developers build and scale their games. One of its key services is **Account Connection**, which provides a range of authentication methods, enabling flexibility when authenticating players and admins.

## Drawbacks of the Previous UX

  alt="Gamestark legacy social connection UX" 
/>

The previous service had a simple and straightforward UX but faced several challenges:

- üôÅ **Limited platform options** and no clear instructions for setting up account connections.
- üôÅ The UI lacked a **dedicated section for an overview and insights**, leaving users unsure about what to do next.

## Opportunity
This redesign presented an opportunity to address these pain points and enhance the user experience. By rethinking the interface and interactions, we aimed to:

- Expand platform options and clarify the setup process.
- Provide users with a complete overview and contextual information at every step.

## Account Connection 2.0 Redesign

#### Setup a New Connection
The redesigned interface allows users to quickly set up connections using pre-configured platforms, saving time and effort.

#### Initial State
If no accounts are connected, users see an empty state screen that simplifies the onboarding process.

#### Activated Platforms List
For users with existing connections, the platforms appear in a clear, comprehensive list.

#### Select the Platform
A new platform selection screen organizes options by type, with short descriptions for added context.

#### Configuration Fields
After selecting a platform, users can input the required details to set up the account connection and identity provider.

To minimize interruptions, comprehensive documentation is embedded directly into the setup flow as step-by-step instructions, ensuring users don‚Äôt need to leave the process for help.

#### Account Setup Successful
Once the connection is successfully configured, visitors to the client‚Äôs webpage can sign in and authorize their accounts through the selected platform (e.g., Twitch).

#### Activate the Connection
