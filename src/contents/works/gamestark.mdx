## Overview
Gamestark is a backend-as-a-service platform that helps game developers build and scale their games. One of the service is Account Connection which provides a range of authentication methods, enabling flexibility when authenticating players and admins.

## Drawbacks of The Previous UX

/>
The previous service has simple and straightforward UX but lack of informations and instructions, has limited platform options, and there‚Äôs no section in the UI designed to provide a complete overview and insights of all relevant context and accessible to users.

- üôÅ¬†Limited platforms available and no instructions to set up the account connection.
- üôÅ¬†The UI doesn‚Äôt have a section that gives a complete overview and relevant context, users can end up feeling confused about what to do next.

## Opportunity
From the product perspective, we see this as a chance to put our best foot forward by redesigning the product service, address all paint points from the user experience.

## Account Connection 2.0 Redesign
We‚Äôve come up with fresh interaction and UI of Account Connection service. This would help our customers integrating third-party authentication and identity provider into their app.

### Setup a new connection
Set up a connection with pre-configured platforms that users can choose to quickly set up, saving them time and effort.

If users don‚Äôt have a connected account yet, this screen will appear, help them save time and avoid the hassle of searching through each platform.

/>

On the other hand, if users already activated some of the platforms, the list will appear in a comprehensive way.

I designed a new screen that puts together all available platforms, organized by type, with a short description for each to provide helpful context.

### Configuration Fields
Once users select a platform, they can input the informations needed to set up a platform as their app‚Äôs account connection and identity provider.

One key aspect I emphasized during the design phase is making comprehensive documentation in a form of step-by-step instructions easily accessible ensuring that users don‚Äôt have to leave the process to search for help, minimizing interruptions and reducing frustration.

### Account Setup successful

Once the account connection is successfully set up, visitors on the client‚Äôs webpage can sign in and authorize their account using the platform‚Äîin this case, Twitch, and make the use of it as an identity provider.
